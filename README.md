# BranchTodoApp
Todo app take home project for Branch

Completed todo list project which supports:

- Creating a new list
- Deleting a list
- Searching for a list based on name or description
- Creating a todo list item
- Deleting a todo list item
- Marking a todo list item as completed
- Searching for a specific todo item within a list

Written using SwiftUI and support for iPhone and iPad interfaces. This project uses the latest iOS15 SDK features so the minimum deployment
target is iOS 15. Uses MVVM architecture and Core Data for data persistance.

If I were to continue with this project, I would like to allow the user to select a custom image for their list along with a custom accent color
for each list similar to the reminders app. I would also like to allow the user to see their completed todo items for each list and I would like to support multiple scenes in an iPadOS environment.

Below is a screenshot of the app used on iPad:
